### Hi y'all! I'm Maxine! ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Maxine (she/her), and I'm a computer engineering undergraduate at UCLA!
- I love making cool stuff! I'm interested in human-computer interaction and how computer see and interact with our world (robotics + computer vision). 
- Some of the cool things I'm currently doing: 
  - ADCS Lead & Flight Software @ ELFIN CubeSat: making satellites spin
  - Events Coordinator @ ACM AI: making ai more accessible for all
  - Developer @ ACM TeachLA: making web apps for education
- In my free time, I enjoy making music, spending time outdoors, gaming, and reading.
