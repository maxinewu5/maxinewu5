### Hi y'all! I'm Maxine! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maxine (she/her), and I'm a computer science undergraduate at UCLA! I love making cool stuff -- especially at the intersection of hardware and software, like how computer perceieve and interact with the world (robotics + vision). In my free time, I enjoy making music, spending time outdoors, gaming, and reading.

#### Currently, I'm...
  - ADCS Flight Software Dev at [ELFIN CubeSat](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), controls and algorithms to make satellites spin fast
  - Developer for [QWER Hacks](https://www.qwerhacks.com/), MLH's first collegiate LGBTQIA+ hackathon :)
  - Advisor (and former Co-President) of [ACM AI](https://www.uclaacm.com/), a community of students who love learning about and building with AI
